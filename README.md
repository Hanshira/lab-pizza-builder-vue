# JS | Pizza Builder with Vue.js

We will redo the pizza builder daily exercise of module 1, but this time using Vue.js.

## Instructions

1. Display all the buttons to toggle ingredients
2. Make them actually toggle the `selected` property
3. Use `isSelected` combined with `v-show` and `:class` to display and hide ingredients in the pizza
4. Display the list of selected ingredients and their price on the right
5. Display the total price
